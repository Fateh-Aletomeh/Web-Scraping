# Web-Scraping
I used BeautifulSoup and matplotlib in order to scrape data from https://www.basketball-reference.com and create graphs on statistics, such as assists or 3 point percentage.
One file (Seasons_Comparison.py) allows the user to compare how the league has changed over the years.
For example, you can see when ppg were at the highest levels in order to understand how the game has evolved.
The second file (Player.py) is still in the works. Once complete, it will enable the user to see how a particular player's stats have changed over the course of their NBA career.
